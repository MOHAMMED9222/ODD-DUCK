Reflections and Comments

How did this go, overall? I was doing good, i tried to do the stored data with dark mode and light mode, didnt work. tried to reorder the fuctions maybe. then it got worse and all the images disappeared. Then the weekend dissapeared.

What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far? stop doing too much.

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? Time still is going. but before the dark mode, i was actually was on pace to be complete saturday.

Consider including the answers to your daily journal and submission questions here This is also a good place to reflect on the tools and resources used and learned
